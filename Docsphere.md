WELCOME TO DOCSPHERE
Theme : HealthCare
Team Name : Dev Dynamos
Idea :
Docsphere is a platform were doctors , students and researchers from various fields of medicine
sciences come together to collaborate , to discuss and to connect with each other, we also provide a
profile building section where a users can select their profession , write about themselves , and build a
great and attractive profile. Docsphere also provide disease mapping option especially for researchers
so that they can find how various diseases are prevailing or at what rate health issues be it mental
health or physical health are spreading. The data is collected from authntic sources like WHO websites.
We also provide a news section where the latest Health related issues , research work , projects etc are
shown , this section provides every user an upto date information on various topics. Further DocSphere
features a very interesting section that is “Contribute” , where users have 2 options either they can write
an article on any health related issue that they are concerned about or The Discussion Forum where
everyone after building their profile and getting verified can discuss on a bunch of topics , they can also
tweet and share their toughts with other people. This will help doctors , students , researchers in India
to connect with others over the globe.
Problem Solved : “Docsphere is like a LinkedIn for people in medical field” or related to it in some or
the other way. We found that it is very important to connect people from the same descipline so that
they can discuss their thoughts on various health issues and this also creates chances of finding a novel
approach to cure some disease. Docsphere will be the first platform where we can connect various
domains of medical science like :
>Neuroscience and mental health
>Immunology and cancer research
>Bioengineering and regenrative Medicine
>Epidomology and public health
and much more. Also DocSphere will provide students and doctors to connect with Healthcare
Institutes and research centres for job openings and other opportunities.
